# Persistence of Gerrymandering example code

This is some of the code used for the paper "The Persistence of Gerrymandering"
by Duchin, Needham and Weighill. 

- bottleneck_distance.py: the main functions needed to convert districting plans into persistence diagrams.
- generate_ensemble.py: an example script for generating an ensemble of Congressional plans for Pennsylvania.
- make_graphics.ipynb: a jupyter notebook for generating some plots from an ensemble.

All of the code requires the open-source ensemble generation code GerryChain (github.com/mggg/GerryChain).
